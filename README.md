# MemTestController
C# helper to automate freeware version of HCI MemTest

Inspired and initially based on https://github.com/integralfx/MemTestHelper

## Usage
Pretty simple.
You need to create an instance of `Controller`.
Then look on methods `StartMemtests`,  `GetCoverages` and `CloseMemtests`

## Example
See `MemtestControllerExample\HCIMemtestRunner.cs`

You need to place freeware version of HCI memtest (memtest.exe) to working directory.
